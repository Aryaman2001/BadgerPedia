# About the app

Developed an Java application in a team of four for CS 400 group project that indexes the restaurants in Downntown Madison and allows the users to be able to search for restaurants and get information like cuisine, ratings and user comments. Simply put, it is a prototype of a specialized Madison version of Yelp for restaurants.

# What I learned

I worked on the backend of the application and learned to implement a hashtable and to handle collisions. I also gained experience in working with a team and collaborating with data wranglers and front end developers.

# Preview of the application

Users interact with the application from console.
